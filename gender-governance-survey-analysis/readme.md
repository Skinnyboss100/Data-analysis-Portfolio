## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data on women’s political participation and representation in governance. The dataset includes structured and unstructured responses collected via a Google Form survey.

## Objectives
- Identify key stakeholders influencing female political participation
- Analyze strategies and mechanisms supporting women in governance
- Examine gendered perceptions of leadership traits
- Combine quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches

## Data Description
- Total respondents: 431
- Data types:
  - Categorical
  - Ordinal (Likert-scale)
  - Multi-select responses
  - Open-ended qualitative responses

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning
- Standardized categorical responses
- Reshaped “select all that apply” questions from wide to long format
- Used regex-based cleaning to preserve commas inside brackets

### Quantitative Analysis
- Univariate frequency and percentage analysis
- Bivariate comparisons (e.g., male vs female leadership perceptions)

### Qualitative Analysis
- Manual thematic coding
- Codebook development
- Theme frequency analysis

## Key Findings
- Executive arm, civil society, and political parties are perceived as key stakeholders
- Institutional and policy-based strategies are strongly favored
- Leadership traits are interpreted differently across genders, indicating bias
- Respondents prefer practical tools and good practice examples

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, regex)
- Excel (Pivot Tables, charts)

## Limitations
- Self-reported survey data
- Descriptive and exploratory analysis; no inferential testing

## Conclusion
The findings highlight the importance of institutional reform, stakeholder collaboration, and addressing gendered perceptions of leadership to promote meaningful female participation in governance.
