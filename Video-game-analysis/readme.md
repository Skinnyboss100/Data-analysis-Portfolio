This project analyzes global video game sales data to identify trends in game performance across regions, platforms, genres, 
publishers, and time.

The analysis demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python for data cleaning and exploration, MySQL for structured 
querying, and Power BI/Tableau for visualization and insights.
